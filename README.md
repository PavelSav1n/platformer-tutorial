# Escape From Lars

2D platformer game based on kaaringaming.com tutorial.

- Redesigned the menu and UI.
- Drew a new player character, enemies and animated them.
- Integrated some trees and bushes.
- Added a ranged attack to a player, which now can throw plastic cups (still no hinting at anything).
- Levels now can be completed by reaching its end.
- Lots of other reworking, fixing bugs, etc.
- The artifact build into a single JAR file, so it can be runned without any IDE. `JDK20 and above is required though`. 
- Special thanks to my friend Gleb Luckanichev, who wrote menu and level soundtracks.
